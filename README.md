# Detecting endangered fish with an underwater lens üêü
This reposity describes the materials and methods used to build an underwater camera equipped with water quality sensors (temperature and dissolved oxygen) using Raspberry Pi and Arduino boards. The set ups described below were tested and deployed in the Old Ausable Channel (OAC) in Lambton Shores, Ontario üá®üá¶ near and within Pinery Provincial Park. The OAC is a narrow, low flow freshwater stream near the south shore of Lake Huron. Due to its natural history the OAC contains a high level of freshwater fish diversity and is home to multiple fish Species-at-Risk. 

The endangered Lake Chubsucker (*Erimyzon sucetta*) calls the OAC home and we were able to use these cameras to capture them across the channel. As seen here in this example still of two adult Lake Chubsucker:

The camera design was originally inspired by this paper: [FishCam: A low-cost open source autonomous camera for aquatic research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ohx.2020.e00110). I highly recommend giving it a read if you're interested in building a camera yourself to do this type of work.

## Camera construction guide
### Configure your Raspberry Pi

If you're not familiar with Raspberry Pi (rpi) computers I recommend following the [Raspberry Pi foundations tutorials](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html) to set it up. You will need to format an sd card with Raspberry Pi OS and solder header pins to the pi if it did not come with them (in order to attach the WittyPi board). 

---

### Configure the power supply

For this project I used a lithium ion battery connected directly to the WittyPi board. The WittyPi board can be loaded with a schedule script that automatically turns your Pi on and off (see the documentation for the WittyPi [here](https://www.uugear.com/doc/WittyPi3Rev2_UserManual.pdf)). I did this to conserve battery power and memory, so that I could deploy my cameras for a week at a time. However, if you want your pi to run continuously after deployment, you don't need to use the WittyPi. You could simply get a power bank from your local outdoors shop and connect it to your pi directly with a usb cable.

### Prepare the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) sensor 

Information about the DO sensor can be found [here](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity__Analog_Dissolved_Oxygen_Sensor_SKU_SEN0237) and [here](https://atlas-scientific.com/kits/surveyor-analog-do-kit/). The tip of the sensor will need to be filled with the appropriate solution (check the documentation of the sensor you have for instructions). 

---

### Configure your Arduino

This project uses an arduino board to collect dissolved oxygen and temperature data, and passes that data to the rpi over i2c through a usb cable. Connect the sensors as shown in the diagram below. Then connect the arduino to a computer with the arduino IDO installed (you can also do this on the rpi). Install the "atlas_gravity.zip", "OneWire-master.zip", and "Arduino-Temperature-Control_Library-master.zip" files (located in this project folder) as libraries to your arduino IDE (sketch > include library > Add .ZIP Library...). Then you can download the "temp_do_combined.ino" file from this project folder and upload it to your arduino through the IDE. 
 
To calibrate your DO sensor, open the serial plotter under the "tools" tab and select a baud rate of 9600 then type CAL. This will set the 100% DO calibration for your sensor.

### Connect the camera 

The camera cable that comes with the rpi camera does not fit with the rpi zero board, so we need to swap it out for the adaptor. If you are using a different raspberry pi board (not a zero) you don't need to do this. This project uses an older camera and legacy camera support needs to be enabled in the rpi configuration for it to work. If you are using a newer camera you won't need to do that, but the python scripts used in this project probably won't work and would need to be adjusted. 

---

### Add the python scripts to the rpi

For my project I creased a folder called "python_scripts" in the home directory. I placed two python scripts in it called: "temp_DO_logging.py" and "video_recording.py". These files are available in this project folder. The "temp_DO_logging.py" script takes the data from the arduino and writes it to a csv file in the "sensor_data" folder in the home directory. The

### Schedule the python scripts 

I scheduled the rpi to run the above python scripts every 4 hours from 7am to 7pm by setting up cron jobs. [This website] has an excellent guide of how to do this. For my project I edited the cron file (in terminal type: crontab -e) with the following: 

>2 7 * * * python /home/pi/python_scripts/temp_DO_logging.py

>5 7 * * * python /home/pi/python_scripts/video_recording.py

>2 11 * * * python /home/pi/python_scripts/temp_DO_logging.py

>5 11 * * * python /home/pi/python_scripts/temp_DO_logging.py

>2 15 * * * python /home/pi/python_scripts/temp_DO_logging.py

>5 15 * * * python /home/pi/python_scripts/temp_DO_logging.py

>2 19 * * * python /home/pi/python_scripts/temp_DO_logging.py

>5 19 * * * python /home/pi/python_scripts/temp_DO_logging.py

### Hardware housing

I placed the camera, rpi, and everything associated with it in a clear lunch container with a locking lid. To allow the DO sensor and temperature sensor to sit in the water, I drilled a hole in the lid of the container and ran the cables through it (I then sealed the hole with marine epoxy). 

The set up was quite boyant so I built platforms out of ABS and PVS pipes and fittings that I filled with pea gravel.
